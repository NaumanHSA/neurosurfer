description: >
  Minimal fast-executing workflow for testing graph execution,
  dependency resolution, and export behavior without external tools.

inputs:
  - query:
      type: string
      required: true
  - format:
      type: string
      default: "bullet"

nodes:
  - id: normalize_input
    purpose: "Normalize and restate the user query."
    goal: >
      Produce a cleaned, concise version of the input query
      that can be reused by downstream nodes.
    expected_result: A single-sentence normalized query.
    tools: []
    mode: text
    export: true
    policy:
      max_new_tokens: 128
      temperature: 0.7

  - id: classify_intent
    depends_on: ["normalize_input"]
    purpose: "Classify the intent of the query."
    goal: >
      Determine what kind of task the query represents
      (e.g., explanation, comparison, instruction, definition).
    expected_result: A structured intent classification.
    tools: []
    mode: structured
    export: true
    policy:
      max_new_tokens: 128
      temperature: 0.7

  - id: generate_answer
    depends_on: ["normalize_input", "classify_intent"]
    purpose: "Generate a short answer to the query."
    goal: >
      Produce a concise response using the normalized query
      and detected intent, optimized for speed.
    expected_result: A short, direct answer (≤ 150 words).
    tools: []
    mode: text
    export: true
    policy:
      max_new_tokens: 256
      temperature: 0.3

outputs:
  - normalize_input
  - classify_intent
  - generate_answer
