Consistently, the most successful implementations use simple, composable patterns rather than complex frameworks. Over the past year, we've worked with dozens of teams building large language model (LLM) agents across industries. Consistently, the most successful implementations weren't using complex frameworks or specialized libraries. Instead, they were building with simple, composable patterns. In this post, we share what we\u2019ve learned from working with our customers and building agents ourselves, and give practical advice for developers on building effective agents. What are agents? \"Agent\" can be defined in several ways. Some customers define agents as fully autonomous systems that operate independently over extended periods, using various tools to accomplish complex tasks. Others use the term to describe more prescriptive implementations that follow predefined workflows. At Anthropic, we categorize all these variations as agentic systems , but draw an important architectural distinction between workflows and agents : Workflows are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths. Agents , on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks. Below, we will explore both types of agentic systems in detail. In Appendix 1 (\u201cAgents in Practice\u201d), we describe two domains where customers have found particular value in using these kinds of systems. When (and when not) to use agents When building applications with LLMs, we recommend finding the simplest solution possible, and only increasing complexity when needed. This might mean not building agentic systems at all. Agentic systems often trade latency and cost for better task performance, and you should consider when this tradeoff makes sense. When more complexity is warranted, workflows offer predictability and consistency for well-defined tasks, whereas agents are the better option when flexibility and model-driven decision-making are needed at scale. For many applications, however, optimizing single LLM calls with retrieval and in-context examples is usually enough. When and how to use frameworks There are many frameworks that make agentic systems easier to implement, including: LangGraph from LangChain; Amazon Bedrock's AI Agent framework ; Rivet , a drag and drop GUI LLM workflow builder; and Vellum , another GUI tool for building and testing complex workflows. These frameworks make it easy to get started by simplifying standard low-level tasks like calling LLMs, defining and parsing tools, and chaining calls together. However, they often create extra layers of abstraction that can obscure the underlying prompts \u200b\u200band responses, making them harder to debug. They can also make it tempting to add complexity when a simpler setup would suffice. We suggest that developers start by using LLM APIs directly: many patterns can be implemented in a few lines of code. If you do use a framework, ensure you understand the underlying code. Incorrect assumptions about what's under the hood are a common source of customer error. See our cookbook for some sample implementations. Building blocks, workflows, and agents In this section, we\u2019ll explore the common patterns for agentic systems we\u2019ve seen in production. We'll start with our foundational building block\u2014the augmented LLM\u2014and progressively increase complexity, from simple compositional workflows to autonomous agents. Building block: The augmented LLM The basic building block of agentic systems is an LLM enhanced with augmentations such as retrieval, tools, and memory. Our current models can actively use these capabilities\u2014generating their own search queries, selecting appropriate tools, and determining what information to retain. The augmented LLM We recommend focusing on two key aspects of the implementation: tailoring these capabilities to your specific use case and ensuring they provide an easy, well-documented interface for your LLM. While there are many ways to implement these augmentations, one approach is through our recently released Model Context Protocol , which allows developers to integrate with a growing ecosystem of third-party tools with a simple client implementation . For the remainder of this post, we'll assume each LLM call has access to these augmented capabilities. Workflow: Prompt chaining Prompt chaining decomposes a task into a sequence of steps, where each LLM call processes the output of the previous one. You can add programmatic checks (see \"gate\u201d in the diagram below) on any intermediate steps to ensure that the process is still on track. The prompt chaining workflow When to use this workflow: This workflow is ideal for situations where the task can be easily and cleanly decomposed into fixed subtasks. The main goal is to trade off latency for higher accuracy, by making each LLM call an easier task. Examples where prompt chaining is useful: Generating Marketing copy, then translating it into a different language. Writing an outline of a document, checking that the outline meets certain criteria, then writing the document based on the outline. Workflow: Routing Routing classifies an input and directs it to a specialized followup task. This workflow allows for separation of concerns, and building more specialized prompts. Without this workflow, optimizing for one kind of input can hurt performance on other inputs. The routing workflow When to use this workflow: Routing works well for complex tasks where there are distinct categories that are better handled separately, and where classification can be handled accurately, either by an LLM or a more traditional classification model/algorithm. Examples where routing is useful: Directing different types of customer service queries (general questions, refund requests, technical support) into different downstream processes, prompts, and tools. Routing easy/common questions to smaller, cost-efficient models like Claude Haiku 4.5 and hard/unusual questions to more capable models like Claude Sonnet 4.5 to optimize for best performance. Workflow: Parallelization LLMs can sometimes work simultaneously on a task and have their outputs aggregated programmatically. This workflow, parallelization, manifests in two key variations: Sectioning : Breaking a task into independent subtasks run in parallel. Voting: Running the same task multiple times to get diverse outputs. The parallelization workflow When to use this workflow: Parallelization is effective when the divided subtasks can be parallelized for speed, or when multiple perspectives or attempts are needed for higher confidence results. For complex tasks with multiple considerations, LLMs generally perform better when each consideration is handled by a separate LLM call, allowing focused attention on each specific aspect. Examples where parallelization is useful: Sectioning : Implementing guardrails where one model instance processes user queries while another screens them for inappropriate content or requests. This tends to perform better than having the same LLM call handle both guardrails and the core response. Automating evals for evaluating LLM performance, where each LLM call evaluates a different aspect of the model\u2019s performance on a given prompt. Voting : Reviewing a piece of code for vulnerabilities, where several different prompts review and flag the code if they find a problem. Evaluating whether a given piece of content is inappropriate, with multiple prompts evaluating different aspects or requiring different vote thresholds to balance false positives and negatives. Workflow: Orchestrator-workers In the orchestrator-workers workflow, a central LLM dynamically breaks down tasks, delegates them to worker LLMs, and synthesizes their results. The orchestrator-workers workflow When to use this workflow: This workflow is well-suited for complex tasks where you can\u2019t predict the subtasks needed (in coding, for example, the number of files that need to be changed and the nature of the change in each file likely depend on the task). Whereas it\u2019s topographically similar, the key difference from parallelization is its flexibility\u2014subtasks aren't pre-defined, but determined by the orchestrator based on the specific input. Example where orchestrator-workers is useful: Coding products that make complex changes to multiple files each time. Search tasks that involve gathering and analyzing information from multiple sources for possible relevant information. Workflow: Evaluator-optimizer In the evaluator-optimizer workflow, one LLM call generates a response while another provides evaluation and feedback in a loop. The evaluator-optimizer workflow When to use this workflow: This workflow is particularly effective when we have clear evaluation criteria, and when iterative refinement provides measurable value. The two signs of good fit are, first, that LLM responses can be demonstrably improved when a human articulates their feedback; and second, that the LLM can provide such feedback. This is analogous to the iterative writing process a human writer might go through when producing a polished document. Examples where evaluator-optimizer is useful: Literary translation where there are nuances that the translator LLM might not capture initially, but where an evaluator LLM can provide useful critiques. Complex search tasks that require multiple rounds of searching and analysis to gather comprehensive information, where the evaluator decides whether further searches are warranted. Agents Agents are emerging in production as LLMs mature in key capabilities\u2014understanding complex inputs, engaging in reasoning and planning, using tools reliably, and recovering from errors. Agents begin their work with either a command from, or interactive discussion with, the human user. Once the task is clear, agents plan and operate independently, potentially returning to the human for further information or judgement. During execution, it's crucial for the agents to gain \u201cground truth\u201d from the environment at each step (such as tool call results or code execution) to assess its progress. Agents can then pause for human feedback at checkpoints or when encountering blockers. The task often terminates upon completion, but it\u2019s also common to include stopping conditions (such as a maximum number of iterations) to maintain control. Agents can handle sophisticated tasks, but their implementation is often straightforward. They are typically just LLMs using tools based on environmental feedback in a loop. It is therefore crucial to design toolsets and their documentation clearly and thoughtfully. We expand on best practices for tool development in Appendix 2 (\"Prompt Engineering your Tools\"). Autonomous agent When to use agents: Agents can be used for open-ended problems where it\u2019s difficult or impossible to predict the required number of steps, and where you can\u2019t hardcode a fixed path. The LLM will potentially operate for many turns, and you must have some level of trust in its decision-making. Agents' autonomy makes them ideal for scaling tasks in trusted environments. The autonomous nature of agents means higher costs, and the potential for compounding errors. We recommend extensive testing in sandboxed environments, along with the appropriate guardrails. Examples where agents are useful: The following examples are from our own implementations: A coding Agent to resolve SWE-bench tasks , which involve edits to many files based on a task description; Our \u201ccomputer use\u201d reference implementation , where Claude uses a computer to accomplish tasks. High-level flow of a coding agent Combining and customizing these patterns These building blocks aren't prescriptive. They're common patterns that developers can shape and combine to fit different use cases. The key to success, as with any LLM features, is measuring performance and iterating on implementations. To repeat: you should consider adding complexity only when it demonstrably improves outcomes. Summary Success in the LLM space isn't about building the most sophisticated system. It's about building the right system for your needs. Start with simple prompts, optimize them with comprehensive evaluation, and add multi-step agentic systems only when simpler solutions fall short. When implementing agents, we try to follow three core principles: Maintain simplicity in your agent's design. Prioritize transparency by explicitly showing the agent\u2019s planning steps. Carefully craft your agent-computer interface (ACI) through thorough tool documentation and testing . Frameworks can help you get started quickly, but don't hesitate to reduce abstraction layers and build with basic components as you move to production. By following these principles, you can create agents that are not only powerful but also reliable, maintainable, and trusted by their users. Acknowledgements Written by Erik Schluntz and Barry Zhang. This work draws upon our experiences building agents at Anthropic and the valuable insights shared by our customers, for which we're deeply grateful. Appendix 1: Agents in practice Our work with customers has revealed two particularly promising applications for AI agents that demonstrate the practical value of the patterns discussed above. Both applications illustrate how agents add the most value for tasks that require both conversation and action, have clear success criteria, enable feedback loops, and integrate meaningful human oversight. A. Customer support Customer support combines familiar chatbot interfaces with enhanced capabilities through tool integration. This is a natural fit for more open-ended agents because: Support interactions naturally follow a conversation flow while requiring access to external information and actions; Tools can be integrated to pull customer data, order history, and knowledge base articles; Actions such as issuing refunds or updating tickets can be handled programmatically; and Success can be clearly measured through user-defined resolutions. Several companies have demonstrated the viability of this approach through usage-based pricing models that charge only for successful resolutions, showing confidence in their agents' effectiveness. B. Coding agents The software development space has shown remarkable potential for LLM features, with capabilities evolving from code completion to autonomous problem-solving. Agents are particularly effective because: Code solutions are verifiable through automated tests; Agents can iterate on solutions using test results as feedback; The problem space is well-defined and structured; and Output quality can be measured objectively. In our own implementation, agents can now solve real GitHub issues in the SWE-bench Verified benchmark based on the pull request description alone. However, whereas automated testing helps verify functionality, human review remains crucial for ensuring solutions align with broader system requirements. Appendix 2: Prompt engineering your tools No matter which agentic system you're building, tools will likely be an important part of your agent. Tools enable Claude to interact with external services and APIs by specifying their exact structure and definition in our API. When Claude responds, it will include a tool use block in the API response if it plans to invoke a tool. Tool definitions and specifications should be given just as much prompt engineering attention as your overall prompts. In this brief appendix, we describe how to prompt engineer your tools. There are often several ways to specify the same action. For instance, you can specify a file edit by writing a diff, or by rewriting the entire file. For structured output, you can return code inside markdown or inside JSON. In software engineering, differences like these are cosmetic and can be converted losslessly from one to the other. However, some formats are much more difficult for an LLM to write than others. Writing a diff requires knowing how many lines are changing in the chunk header before the new code is written. Writing code inside JSON (compared to markdown) requires extra escaping of newlines and quotes. Our suggestions for deciding on tool formats are the following: Give the model enough tokens to \"think\" before it writes itself into a corner. Keep the format close to what the model has seen naturally occurring in text on the internet. Make sure there's no formatting \"overhead\" such as having to keep an accurate count of thousands of lines of code, or string-escaping any code it writes. One rule of thumb is to think about how much effort goes into human-computer interfaces (HCI), and plan to invest just as much effort in creating good agent -computer interfaces (ACI). Here are some thoughts on how to do so: Put yourself in the model's shoes. Is it obvious how to use this tool, based on the description and parameters, or would you need to think carefully about it? If so, then it\u2019s probably also true for the model. A good tool definition often includes example usage, edge cases, input format requirements, and clear boundaries from other tools. How can you change parameter names or descriptions to make things more obvious? Think of this as writing a great docstring for a junior developer on your team. This is especially important when using many similar tools. Test how the model uses your tools: Run many example inputs in our workbench to see what mistakes the model makes, and iterate. Poka-yoke your tools. Change the arguments so that it is harder to make mistakes. While building our agent for SWE-bench , we actually spent more time optimizing our tools than the overall prompt. For example, we found that the model would make mistakes with tools using relative filepaths after the agent had moved out of the root directory. To fix this, we changed the tool to always require absolute filepaths\u2014and we found that the model used this method flawlessly.

Some customers define agents as fully autonomous systems that operate independently over extended periods, using various tools to accomplish complex tasks. Others use the term to describe more prescriptive implementations that follow predefined workflows. At Anthropic, we categorize all these variations as agentic systems , but draw an important architectural distinction between workflows and agents : Workflows are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths. Agents , on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks. Below, we will explore both types of agentic systems in detail. In Appendix 1 (\u201cAgents in Practice\u201d), we describe two domains where customers have found particular value in using these kinds of systems. When (and when not) to use agents When building applications with LLMs, we recommend finding the simplest solution possible, and only increasing complexity when needed. This might mean not building agentic systems at all. Agentic systems often trade latency and cost for better task performance, and you should consider when this tradeoff makes sense. When more complexity is warranted, workflows offer predictability and consistency for well-defined tasks, whereas agents are the better option when flexibility and model-driven decision-making are needed at scale. For many applications, however, optimizing single LLM calls with retrieval and in-context examples is usually enough. When and how to use frameworks There are many frameworks that make agentic systems easier to implement, including: LangGraph from LangChain; Amazon Bedrock's AI Agent framework ; Rivet , a drag and drop GUI LLM workflow builder; and Vellum , another GUI tool for building and testing complex workflows. These frameworks make it easy to get started by simplifying standard low-level tasks like calling LLMs, defining and parsing tools, and chaining calls together. However, they often create extra layers of abstraction that can obscure the underlying prompts \u200b\u200band responses, making them harder to debug. They can also make it tempting to add complexity when a simpler setup would suffice. We suggest that developers start by using LLM APIs directly: many patterns can be implemented in a few lines of code. If you do use a framework, ensure you understand the underlying code. Incorrect assumptions about what's under the hood are a common source of customer error. See our cookbook for some sample implementations. Building blocks, workflows, and agents In this section, we\u2019ll explore the common patterns for agentic systems we\u2019ve seen in production. We'll start with our foundational building block\u2014the augmented LLM\u2014and progressively increase complexity, from simple compositional workflows to autonomous agents. Building block: The augmented LLM The basic building block of agentic systems is an LLM enhanced with augmentations such as retrieval, tools, and memory. Our current models can actively use these capabilities\u2014generating their own search queries, selecting appropriate tools, and determining what information to retain. The augmented LLM We recommend focusing on two key aspects of the implementation: tailoring these capabilities to your specific use case and ensuring they provide an easy, well-documented interface for your LLM. While there are many ways to implement these augmentations, one approach is through our recently released Model Context Protocol , which allows developers to integrate with a growing ecosystem of third-party tools with a simple client implementation . For the remainder of this post, we'll assume each LLM call has access to these augmented capabilities. Workflow: Prompt chaining Prompt chaining decomposes a task into a sequence of steps, where each LLM call processes the output of the previous one. You can add programmatic checks (see \"gate\u201d in the diagram below) on any intermediate steps to ensure that the process is still on track. The prompt chaining workflow When to use this workflow: This workflow is ideal for situations where the task can be easily and cleanly decomposed into fixed subtasks. The main goal is to trade off latency for higher accuracy, by making each LLM call an easier task. Examples where prompt chaining is useful: Generating Marketing copy, then translating it into a different language. Writing an outline of a document, checking that the outline meets certain criteria, then writing the document based on the outline. Workflow: Routing Routing classifies an input and directs it to a specialized followup task. This workflow allows for separation of concerns, and building more specialized prompts. Without this workflow, optimizing for one kind of input can hurt performance on other inputs. The routing workflow When to use this workflow: Routing works well for complex tasks where there are distinct categories that are better handled separately, and where classification can be handled accurately, either by an LLM or a more traditional classification model/algorithm. Examples where routing is useful: Directing different types of customer service queries (general questions, refund requests, technical support) into different downstream processes, prompts, and tools. Routing easy/common questions to smaller, cost-efficient models like Claude Haiku 4.5 and hard/unusual questions to more capable models like Claude Sonnet 4.5 to optimize for best performance. Workflow: Parallelization LLMs can sometimes work simultaneously on a task and have their outputs aggregated programmatically. This workflow, parallelization, manifests in two key variations: Sectioning : Breaking a task into independent subtasks run in parallel. Voting: Running the same task multiple times to get diverse outputs. The parallelization workflow When to use this workflow: Parallelization is effective when the divided subtasks can be parallelized for speed, or when multiple perspectives or attempts are needed for higher confidence results. For complex tasks with multiple considerations, LLMs generally perform better when each consideration is handled by a separate LLM call, allowing focused attention on each specific aspect. Examples where parallelization is useful: Sectioning : Implementing guardrails where one model instance processes user queries while another screens them for inappropriate content or requests. This tends to perform better than having the same LLM call handle both guardrails and the core response. Automating evals for evaluating LLM performance, where each LLM call evaluates a different aspect of the model\u2019s performance on a given prompt. Voting : Reviewing a piece of code for vulnerabilities, where several different prompts review and flag the code if they find a problem. Evaluating whether a given piece of content is inappropriate, with multiple prompts evaluating different aspects or requiring different vote thresholds to balance false positives and negatives. Workflow: Orchestrator-workers In the orchestrator-workers workflow, a central LLM dynamically breaks down tasks, delegates them to worker LLMs, and synthesizes their results. The orchestrator-workers workflow When to use this workflow: This workflow is well-suited for complex tasks where you can\u2019t predict the subtasks needed (in coding, for example, the number of files that need to be changed and the nature of the change in each file likely depend on the task). Whereas it\u2019s topographically similar, the key difference from parallelization is its flexibility\u2014subtasks aren't pre-defined, but determined by the orchestrator based on the specific input. Example where orchestrator-workers is useful: Coding products that make complex changes to multiple files each time. Search tasks that involve gathering and analyzing information from multiple sources for possible relevant information. Workflow: Evaluator-optimizer In the evaluator-optimizer workflow, one LLM call generates a response while another provides evaluation and feedback in a loop. The evaluator-optimizer workflow When to use this workflow: This workflow is particularly effective when we have clear evaluation criteria, and when iterative refinement provides measurable value. The two signs of good fit are, first, that LLM responses can be demonstrably improved when a human articulates their feedback; and second, that the LLM can provide such feedback. This is analogous to the iterative writing process a human writer might go through when producing a polished document. Examples where evaluator-optimizer is useful: Literary translation where there are nuances that the translator LLM might not capture initially, but where an evaluator LLM can provide useful critiques. Complex search tasks that require multiple rounds of searching and analysis to gather comprehensive information, where the evaluator decides whether further searches are warranted. Agents Agents are emerging in production as LLMs mature in key capabilities\u2014understanding complex inputs, engaging in reasoning and planning, using tools reliably, and recovering from errors. Agents begin their work with either a command from, or interactive discussion with, the human user. Once the task is clear, agents plan and operate independently, potentially returning to the human for further information or judgement. During execution, it's crucial for the agents to gain \u201cground truth\u201d from the environment at each step (such as tool call results or code execution) to assess its progress. Agents can then pause for human feedback at checkpoints or when encountering blockers. The task often terminates upon completion, but it\u2019s also common to include stopping conditions (such as a maximum number of iterations) to maintain control. Agents can handle sophisticated tasks, but their implementation is often straightforward. They are typically just LLMs using tools based on environmental feedback in a loop. It is therefore crucial to design toolsets and their documentation clearly and thoughtfully. We expand on best practices for tool development in Appendix 2 (\"Prompt Engineering your Tools\"). Autonomous agent When to use agents: Agents can be used for open-ended problems where it\u2019s difficult or impossible to predict the required number of steps, and where you can\u2019t hardcode a fixed path. The LLM will potentially operate for many turns, and you must have some level of trust in its decision-making. Agents' autonomy makes them ideal for scaling tasks in trusted environments. The autonomous nature of agents means higher costs, and the potential for compounding errors. We recommend extensive testing in sandboxed environments, along with the appropriate guardrails. Examples where agents are useful: The following examples are from our own implementations: A coding Agent to resolve SWE-bench tasks , which involve edits to many files based on a task description; Our \u201ccomputer use\u201d reference implementation , where Claude uses a computer to accomplish tasks. High-level flow of a coding agent Combining and customizing these patterns These building blocks aren't prescriptive. They're common patterns that developers can shape and combine to fit different use cases. The key to success, as with any LLM features, is measuring performance and iterating on implementations. To repeat: you should consider adding complexity only when it demonstrably improves outcomes. Summary Success in the LLM space isn't about building the most sophisticated system. It's about building the right system for your needs. Start with simple prompts, optimize them with comprehensive evaluation, and add multi-step agentic systems only when simpler solutions fall short. When implementing agents, we try to follow three core principles: Maintain simplicity in your agent's design. Prioritize transparency by explicitly showing the agent\u2019s planning steps. Carefully craft your agent-computer interface (ACI) through thorough tool documentation and testing . Frameworks can help you get started quickly, but don't hesitate to reduce abstraction layers and build with basic components as you move to production. By following these principles, you can create agents that are not only powerful but also reliable, maintainable, and trusted by their users. Acknowledgements Written by Erik Schluntz and Barry Zhang. This work draws upon our experiences building agents at Anthropic and the valuable insights shared by our customers, for which we're deeply grateful. Appendix 1: Agents in practice Our work with customers has revealed two particularly promising applications for AI agents that demonstrate the practical value of the patterns discussed above. Both applications illustrate how agents add the most value for tasks that require both conversation and action, have clear success criteria, enable feedback loops, and integrate meaningful human oversight. A. Customer support Customer support combines familiar chatbot interfaces with enhanced capabilities through tool integration. This is a natural fit for more open-ended agents because: Support interactions naturally follow a conversation flow while requiring access to external information and actions; Tools can be integrated to pull customer data, order history, and knowledge base articles; Actions such as issuing refunds or updating tickets can be handled programmatically; and Success can be clearly measured through user-defined resolutions. Several companies have demonstrated the viability of this approach through usage-based pricing models that charge only for successful resolutions, showing confidence in their agents' effectiveness. B. Coding agents The software development space has shown remarkable potential for LLM features, with capabilities evolving from code completion to autonomous problem-solving. Agents are particularly effective because: Code solutions are verifiable through automated tests; Agents can iterate on solutions using test results as feedback; The problem space is well-defined and structured; and Output quality can be measured objectively. In our own implementation, agents can now solve real GitHub issues in the SWE-bench Verified benchmark based on the pull request description alone. However, whereas automated testing helps verify functionality, human review remains crucial for ensuring solutions align with broader system requirements. Appendix 2: Prompt engineering your tools No matter which agentic system you're building, tools will likely be an important part of your agent. Tools enable Claude to interact with external services and APIs by specifying their exact structure and definition in our API. When Claude responds, it will include a tool use block in the API response if it plans to invoke a tool. Tool definitions and specifications should be given just as much prompt engineering attention as your overall prompts. In this brief appendix, we describe how to prompt engineer your tools. There are often several ways to specify the same action. For instance, you can specify a file edit by writing a diff, or by rewriting the entire file. For structured output, you can return code inside markdown or inside JSON. In software engineering, differences like these are cosmetic and can be converted losslessly from one to the other. However, some formats are much more difficult for an LLM to write than others. Writing a diff requires knowing how many lines are changing in the chunk header before the new code is written. Writing code inside JSON (compared to markdown) requires extra escaping of newlines and quotes. Our suggestions for deciding on tool formats are the following: Give the model enough tokens to \"think\" before it writes itself into a corner. Keep the format close to what the model has seen naturally occurring in text on the internet. Make sure there's no formatting \"overhead\" such as having to keep an accurate count of thousands of lines of code, or string-escaping any code it writes. One rule of thumb is to think about how much effort goes into human-computer interfaces (HCI), and plan to invest just as much effort in creating good agent -computer interfaces (ACI). Here are some thoughts on how to do so: Put yourself in the model's shoes. Is it obvious how to use this tool, based on the description and parameters, or would you need to think carefully about it? If so, then it\u2019s probably also true for the model. A good tool definition often includes example usage, edge cases, input format requirements, and clear boundaries from other tools. How can you change parameter names or descriptions to make things more obvious? Think of this as writing a great docstring for a junior developer on your team. This is especially important when using many similar tools. Test how the model uses your tools: Run many example inputs in our workbench to see what mistakes the model makes, and iterate. Poka-yoke your tools. Change the arguments so that it is harder to make mistakes. While building our agent for SWE-bench , we actually spent more time optimizing our tools than the overall prompt. For example, we found that the model would make mistakes with tools using relative filepaths after the agent had moved out of the root directory. To fix this, we changed the tool to always require absolute filepaths\u2014and we found that the model used this method flawlessly.

Consistently, the most successful implementations use simple, composable patterns rather than complex frameworks. Over the past year, we've worked with dozens of teams building large language model (LLM) agents across industries. Consistently, the most successful implementations weren't using complex frameworks or specialized libraries. Instead, they were building with simple, composable patterns. In this post, we share what we\u2019ve learned from working with our customers and building agents ourselves, and give practical advice for developers on building effective agents. What are agents? \"Agent\" can be defined in several ways. Some customers define agents as fully autonomous systems that operate independently over extended periods, using various tools to accomplish complex tasks. Others use the term to describe more prescriptive implementations that follow predefined workflows. At Anthropic, we categorize all these variations as agentic systems , but draw an important architectural distinction between workflows and agents : Workflows are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths. Agents , on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks. Below, we will explore both types of agentic systems in detail. In Appendix 1 (\u201cAgents in Practice\u201d), we describe two domains where customers have found particular value in using these kinds of systems. When (and when not) to use agents When building applications with LLMs, we recommend finding the simplest solution possible, and only increasing complexity when needed. This might mean not building agentic systems at all. Agentic systems often trade latency and cost for better task performance, and you should consider when this tradeoff makes sense. When more complexity is warranted, workflows offer predictability and consistency for well-defined tasks, whereas agents are the better option when flexibility and model-driven decision-making are needed at scale. For many applications, however, optimizing single LLM calls with retrieval and in-context examples is usually enough. When and how to use frameworks There are many frameworks that make agentic systems easier to implement, including: LangGraph from LangChain; Amazon Bedrock's AI Agent framework ; Rivet , a drag and drop GUI LLM workflow builder; and Vellum , another GUI tool for building and testing complex workflows. These frameworks make it easy to get started by simplifying standard low-level tasks like calling LLMs, defining and parsing tools, and chaining calls together. However, they often create extra layers of abstraction that can obscure the underlying prompts \u200b\u200band responses, making them harder to debug. They can also make it tempting to add complexity when a simpler setup would suffice. We suggest that developers start by using LLM APIs directly: many patterns can be implemented in a few lines of code. If you do use a framework, ensure you understand the underlying code. Incorrect assumptions about what's under the hood are a common source of customer error. See our cookbook for some sample implementations. Building blocks, workflows, and agents In this section, we\u2019ll explore the common patterns for agentic systems we\u2019ve seen in production. We'll start with our foundational building block\u2014the augmented LLM\u2014and progressively increase complexity, from simple compositional workflows to autonomous agents. Building block: The augmented LLM The basic building block of agentic systems is an LLM enhanced with augmentations such as retrieval, tools, and memory. Our current models can actively use these capabilities\u2014generating their own search queries, selecting appropriate tools, and determining what information to retain. The augmented LLM We recommend focusing on two key aspects of the implementation: tailoring these capabilities to your specific use case and ensuring they provide an easy, well-documented interface for your LLM. While there are many ways to implement these augmentations, one approach is through our recently released Model Context Protocol , which allows developers to integrate with a growing ecosystem of third-party tools with a simple client implementation . For the remainder of this post, we'll assume each LLM call has access to these augmented capabilities. Workflow: Prompt chaining Prompt chaining decomposes a task into a sequence of steps, where each LLM call processes the output of the previous one. You can add programmatic checks (see \"gate\u201d in the diagram below) on any intermediate steps to ensure that the process is still on track. The prompt chaining workflow When to use this workflow: This workflow is ideal for situations where the task can be easily and cleanly decomposed into fixed subtasks. The main goal is to trade off latency for higher accuracy, by making each LLM call an easier task. Examples where prompt chaining is useful: Generating Marketing copy, then translating it into a different language. Writing an outline of a document, checking that the outline meets certain criteria, then writing the document based on the outline. Workflow: Routing Routing classifies an input and directs it to a specialized followup task. This workflow allows for separation of concerns, and building more specialized prompts. Without this workflow, optimizing for one kind of input can hurt performance on other inputs. The routing workflow When to use this workflow: Routing works well for complex tasks where there are distinct categories that are better handled separately, and where classification can be handled accurately, either by an LLM or a more traditional classification model/algorithm. Examples where routing is useful: Directing different types of customer service queries (general questions, refund requests, technical support) into different downstream processes, prompts, and tools. Routing easy/common questions to smaller, cost-efficient models like Claude Haiku 4.5 and hard/unusual questions to more capable models like Claude Sonnet 4.5 to optimize for best performance. Workflow: Parallelization LLMs can sometimes work simultaneously on a task and have their outputs aggregated programmatically. This workflow, parallelization, manifests in two key variations: Sectioning : Breaking a task into independent subtasks run in parallel. Voting: Running the same task multiple times to get diverse outputs. The parallelization workflow When to use this workflow: Parallelization is effective when the divided subtasks can be parallelized for speed, or when multiple perspectives or attempts are needed for higher confidence results. For complex tasks with multiple considerations, LLMs generally perform better when each consideration is handled by a separate LLM call, allowing focused attention on each specific aspect. Examples where parallelization is useful: Sectioning : Implementing guardrails where one model instance processes user queries while another screens them for inappropriate content or requests. This tends to perform better than having the same LLM call handle both guardrails and the core response. Automating evals for evaluating LLM performance, where each LLM call evaluates a different aspect of the model\u2019s performance on a given prompt. Voting : Reviewing a piece of code for vulnerabilities, where several different prompts review and flag the code if they find a problem. Evaluating whether a given piece of content is inappropriate, with multiple prompts evaluating different aspects or requiring different vote thresholds to balance false positives and negatives. Workflow: Orchestrator-workers In the orchestrator-workers workflow, a central LLM dynamically breaks down tasks, delegates them to worker LLMs, and synthesizes their results. The orchestrator-workers workflow When to use this workflow: This workflow is well-suited for complex tasks where you can\u2019t predict the subtasks needed (in coding, for example, the number of files that need to be changed and the nature of the change in each file likely depend on the task). Whereas it\u2019s topographically similar, the key difference from parallelization is its flexibility\u2014subtasks aren't pre-defined, but determined by the orchestrator based on the specific input. Example where orchestrator-workers is useful: Coding products that make complex changes to multiple files each time. Search tasks that involve gathering and analyzing information from multiple sources for possible relevant information. Workflow: Evaluator-optimizer In the evaluator-optimizer workflow, one LLM call generates a response while another provides evaluation and feedback in a loop. The evaluator-optimizer workflow When to use this workflow: This workflow is particularly effective when we have clear evaluation criteria, and when iterative refinement provides measurable value. The two signs of good fit are, first, that LLM responses can be demonstrably improved when a human articulates their feedback; and second, that the LLM can provide such feedback. This is analogous to the iterative writing process a human writer might go through when producing a polished document. Examples where evaluator-optimizer is useful: Literary translation where there are nuances that the translator LLM might not capture initially, but where an evaluator LLM can provide useful critiques. Complex search tasks that require multiple rounds of searching and analysis to gather comprehensive information, where the evaluator decides whether further searches are warranted. Agents Agents are emerging in production as LLMs mature in key capabilities\u2014understanding complex inputs, engaging in reasoning and planning, using tools reliably, and recovering from errors. Agents begin their work with either a command from, or interactive discussion with, the human user. Once the task is clear, agents plan and operate independently, potentially returning to the human for further information or judgement. During execution, it's crucial for the agents to gain \u201cground truth\u201d from the environment at each step (such as tool call results or code execution) to assess its progress. Agents can then pause for human feedback at checkpoints or when encountering blockers. The task often terminates upon completion, but it\u2019s also common to include stopping conditions (such as a maximum number of iterations) to maintain control. Agents can handle sophisticated tasks, but their implementation is often straightforward. They are typically just LLMs using tools based on environmental feedback in a loop. It is therefore crucial to design toolsets and their documentation clearly and thoughtfully. We expand on best practices for tool development in Appendix 2 (\"Prompt Engineering your Tools\"). Autonomous agent When to use agents: Agents can be used for open-ended problems where it\u2019s difficult or impossible to predict the required number of steps, and where you can\u2019t hardcode a fixed path. The LLM will potentially operate for many turns, and you must have some level of trust in its decision-making. Agents' autonomy makes them ideal for scaling tasks in trusted environments. The autonomous nature of agents means higher costs, and the potential for compounding errors. We recommend extensive testing in sandboxed environments, along with the appropriate guardrails. Examples where agents are useful: The following examples are from our own implementations: A coding Agent to resolve SWE-bench tasks , which involve edits to many files based on a task description; Our \u201ccomputer use\u201d reference implementation , where Claude uses a computer to accomplish tasks. High-level flow of a coding agent Combining and customizing these patterns These building blocks aren't prescriptive. They're common patterns that developers can shape and combine to fit different use cases. The key to success, as with any LLM features, is measuring performance and iterating on implementations. To repeat: you should consider adding complexity only when it demonstrably improves outcomes. Summary Success in the LLM space isn't about building the most sophisticated system. It's about building the right system for your needs. Start with simple prompts, optimize them with comprehensive evaluation, and add multi-step agentic systems only when simpler solutions fall short. When implementing agents, we try to follow three core principles: Maintain simplicity in your agent's design. Prioritize transparency by explicitly showing the agent\u2019s planning steps. Carefully craft your agent-computer interface (ACI) through thorough tool documentation and testing . Frameworks can help you get started quickly, but don't hesitate to reduce abstraction layers and build with basic components as you move to production. By following these principles, you can create agents that are not only powerful but also reliable, maintainable, and trusted by their users. Acknowledgements Written by Erik Schluntz and Barry Zhang. This work draws upon our experiences building agents at Anthropic and the valuable insights shared by our customers, for which we're deeply grateful. Appendix 1: Agents in practice Our work with customers has revealed two particularly promising applications for AI agents that demonstrate the practical value of the patterns discussed above. Both applications illustrate how agents add the most value for tasks that require both conversation and action, have clear success criteria, enable feedback loops, and integrate meaningful human oversight. A. Customer support Customer support combines familiar chatbot interfaces with enhanced capabilities through tool integration. This is a natural fit for more open-ended agents because: Support interactions naturally follow a conversation flow while requiring access to external information and actions; Tools can be integrated to pull customer data, order history, and knowledge base articles; Actions such as issuing refunds or updating tickets can be handled programmatically; and Success can be clearly measured through user-defined resolutions. Several companies have demonstrated the viability of this approach through usage-based pricing models that charge only for successful resolutions, showing confidence in their agents' effectiveness. B. Coding agents The software development space has shown remarkable potential for LLM features, with capabilities evolving from code completion to autonomous problem-solving. Agents are particularly effective because: Code solutions are verifiable through automated tests; Agents can iterate on solutions using test results as feedback; The problem space is well-defined and structured; and Output quality can be measured objectively. In our own implementation, agents can now solve real GitHub issues in the SWE-bench Verified benchmark based on the pull request description alone. However, whereas automated testing helps verify functionality, human review remains crucial for ensuring solutions align with broader system requirements. Appendix 2: Prompt engineering your tools No matter which agentic system you're building, tools will likely be an important part of your agent. Tools enable Claude to interact with external services and APIs by specifying their exact structure and definition in our API. When Claude responds, it will include a tool use block in the API response if it plans to invoke a tool. Tool definitions and specifications should be given just as much prompt engineering attention as your overall prompts. In this brief appendix, we describe how to prompt engineer your tools. There are often several ways to specify the same action. For instance, you can specify a file edit by writing a diff, or by rewriting the entire file. For structured output, you can return code inside markdown or inside JSON. In software engineering, differences like these are cosmetic and can be converted losslessly from one to the other. However, some formats are much more difficult for an LLM to write than others. Writing a diff requires knowing how many lines are changing in the chunk header before the new code is written. Writing code inside JSON (compared to markdown) requires extra escaping of newlines and quotes. Our suggestions for deciding on tool formats are the following: Give the model enough tokens to \"think\" before it writes itself into a corner. Keep the format close to what the model has seen naturally occurring in text on the internet. Make sure there's no formatting \"overhead\" such as having to keep an accurate count of thousands of lines of code, or string-escaping any code it writes. One rule of thumb is to think about how much effort goes into human-computer interfaces (HCI), and plan to invest just as much effort in creating good agent -computer interfaces (ACI). Here are some thoughts on how to do so: Put yourself in the model's shoes. Is it obvious how to use this tool, based on the description and parameters, or would you need to think carefully about it? If so, then it\u2019s probably also true for the model. A good tool definition often includes example usage, edge cases, input format requirements, and clear boundaries from other tools. How can you change parameter names or descriptions to make things more obvious? Think of this as writing a great docstring for a junior developer on your team. This is especially important when using many similar tools. Test how the model uses your tools: Run many example inputs in our workbench to see what mistakes the model makes, and iterate. Poka-yoke your tools. Change the arguments so that it is harder to make mistakes. While building our agent for SWE-bench , we actually spent more time optimizing our tools than the overall prompt. For example, we found that the model would make mistakes with tools using relative filepaths after the agent had moved out of the root directory. To fix this, we changed the tool to always require absolute filepaths\u2014and we found that the model used this method flawlessly.

            "raw_output": "# Understanding LLM Agents: From Concept to Reliable Workflows\n\n## Introduction to LLM Agents\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, enabling machines to understand, generate, and respond to human language with remarkable fluency. However, as these models grow in complexity and capability, the need for structured and reliable ways to harness their power becomes increasingly important. This is where **LLM agents** come into play.\n\nAn LLM agent is an autonomous system that leverages a large language model to perform specific tasks. Unlike traditional LLMs, which are static and reactive, agents are dynamic, capable of planning, decision-making, and interacting with external tools. These agents can be used for a wide range of applications, from customer service chatbots to data analysis assistants and even creative writing collaborators.\n\n## The Role of External Tools in LLM Agents\n\nWhile LLMs are powerful, they are not omnipotent. They have limitations in terms of data access, real-time information, and execution of complex tasks. This is where **external tools** come in. These tools can be APIs, databases, or other software systems that an LLM agent can interact with to enhance its capabilities.\n\nFor instance, an LLM agent designed to help with financial planning might use an external API to fetch real-time stock prices, or a database to access user-specific financial data. Another example is a customer support agent that integrates with a CRM system to retrieve user history and provide personalized responses.\n\nThe integration of external tools allows LLM agents to:\n\n- **Access up-to-date information**: Ensuring responses are current and accurate.\n- **Perform actions beyond text generation**: Such as scheduling appointments, sending emails, or updating records.\n- **Enhance reliability**: By offloading tasks that the LLM is not equipped to handle directly.\n\n## Designing Reliable Workflows for LLM Agents\n\nDesigning reliable workflows for LLM agents involves more than just connecting them to external tools. It requires careful planning, error handling, and iterative testing. A well-designed workflow ensures that the agent can operate consistently, even in unpredictable scenarios.\n\n### Key Components of a Reliable Workflow\n\n1. **Input Handling**: The agent must be able to receive and interpret user inputs accurately. This includes understanding different formats, handling ambiguity, and filtering irrelevant information.\n\n2. **Tool Integration**: The agent should be able to seamlessly interact with external tools. This involves setting up secure connections, managing authentication, and ensuring data privacy.\n\n3. **Decision Making**: The agent must make informed decisions based on both its internal knowledge and external data. This requires a clear logic structure, often implemented through rule-based systems or more advanced reasoning frameworks.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: Workflows must include mechanisms for error detection and recovery. If a tool fails or returns invalid data, the agent should have a fallback strategy, such as retrying the request, using cached data, or informing the user of the issue.\n\n5. **Feedback Loops**: Continuous learning and improvement are essential for long-term reliability. By collecting user feedback and performance data, the agent can be refined to better meet user needs.\n\n### Example: A Customer Support Agent Workflow\n\nLet\u2019s consider a customer support agent that helps users with account-related queries. The workflow might look like this:\n\n1. **User Input**: The user asks, \"How do I reset my password?\"\n2. **Intent Recognition**: The agent identifies the intent as a password reset request.\n3. **Tool Integration**: The agent connects to the company's authentication API.\n4. **Action Execution**: The API generates a password reset link and sends it to the user's registered email.\n5. **Confirmation**: The agent informs the user that the link has been sent and provides instructions on how to proceed.\n6. **Error Handling**: If the email service is down, the agent informs the user and suggests alternative methods, such as contacting support via chat.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that the agent operates reliably and efficiently, even when external systems are not perfect.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLLM agents represent a powerful new paradigm in AI, combining the linguistic prowess of large language models with the actionable capabilities of external tools. By designing reliable workflows that incorporate these elements, developers can create intelligent systems that are not only capable but also trustworthy. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of LLM agents into real-world applications will become more seamless, opening up new possibilities for automation, personalization, and human-computer interaction.",

A brief explanation of what this means \u2014 i.e., a language model that interacts with external tools to perform specific tasks \u2014 would help readers unfamiliar with the concept.\n\n- **How do tools integrate with LLMs?**  \n  The section on \"How tools integrate\" is vague. A more detailed explanation of the architecture (e.g., API calls, function calling, or retrieval mechanisms) would improve clarity.\n\n- **What are the key challenges?**  \n  The section on \"Challenges\" is brief and lacks depth. It would benefit from a more thorough discussion of issues like hallucination, alignment, and tool reliability.\n\n#### 2. **Unclear Sections**\n- **\"Best Practices for Designing Reliable Workflows\"**  \n  This section is underdeveloped. It would be more helpful if it included specific strategies such as:\n  - Error handling and recovery mechanisms\n  - Version control for tools and LLMs\n  - User feedback loops for improving accuracy\n\n- **\"Real-world Use Cases\"**  \n  The current examples are generic. Including specific, real-world applications (e.g., customer support automation, data analysis pipelines, or code debugging) would make the content more engaging and informative.\n\n#### 3. **Stylistic and Flow Issues**\n- **Tone and Readability**:  \n  The tone is generally professional, but some sentences are overly technical or jargon-heavy. Consider simplifying complex phrases for better readability without sacrificing precision.\n\n- **Pacing**:  \n  The post moves quickly through concepts without sufficient pauses for reflection. A more deliberate pacing, especially in the \"Challenges\" and \"Best Practices\" sections, would help the reader process the information more effectively.\n\n- **Conclusion**:  \n  The conclusion is abrupt and lacks a strong closing statement. It should summarize the key takeaways and perhaps suggest future directions or open questions in the field.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc **Actionable Suggestions**\n\n1. **Define Key Terms Early**:  \n   - Add a brief definition of \"tool-augmented LLM agents\" at the beginning of the post.\n   - Clarify what is meant by \"reliable workflows\" and how it differs from traditional automation.\n\n2. **Expand on Tool Integration**:  \n   - Include a diagram or code snippet (e.g., a simple function call example) to illustrate how tools are integrated with LLMs.\n\n3. **Deepen the Challenges Section**:  \n   - Discuss specific challenges such as:\n     - **Hallucination** in the context of tool usage\n     - **Latency and reliability** of external APIs\n     - **Security and privacy concerns**\n\n4. **Add Real-World Examples**:  \n   - Provide 2\u20133 detailed examples of tool-augmented workflows in different domains (e.g., finance, healthcare, customer service).\n\n5. **Revise the Conclusion**:  \n   - End with a strong summary of the value of tool-augmented agents and a forward-looking statement about the future of this technology.\n\n6. **Improve Readability**:  \n   - Break up long paragraphs into shorter ones.\n   - Use bullet points or numbered lists where appropriate (e.g., in the \"Best Practices\" section).\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Final Notes**\nThe draft is a solid foundation for a technical blog post on tool-augmented LLM agents. With clearer definitions, deeper explanations, and improved structure, it would be even more valuable to readers.

        "draft": "# Understanding LLM Agents: From Concept to Reliable Workflows\n\n## Introduction to LLM Agents\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, enabling machines to understand, generate, and respond to human language with remarkable fluency. However, as these models grow in complexity and capability, the need for structured and reliable ways to harness their power becomes increasingly important. This is where **LLM agents** come into play.\n\nAn LLM agent is an autonomous system that leverages a large language model to perform specific tasks. Unlike traditional LLMs, which are static and reactive, agents are dynamic, capable of planning, decision-making, and interacting with external tools. These agents can be used for a wide range of applications, from customer service chatbots to data analysis assistants and even creative writing collaborators.\n\n## The Role of External Tools in LLM Agents\n\nWhile LLMs are powerful, they are not omnipotent. They have limitations in terms of data access, real-time information, and execution of complex tasks. This is where **external tools** come in. These tools can be APIs, databases, or other software systems that an LLM agent can interact with to enhance its capabilities.\n\nFor instance, an LLM agent designed to help with financial planning might use an external API to fetch real-time stock prices, or a database to access user-specific financial data. Another example is a customer support agent that integrates with a CRM system to retrieve user history and provide personalized responses.\n\nThe integration of external tools allows LLM agents to:\n\n- **Access up-to-date information**: Ensuring responses are current and accurate.\n- **Perform actions beyond text generation**: Such as scheduling appointments, sending emails, or updating records.\n- **Enhance reliability**: By offloading tasks that the LLM is not equipped to handle directly.\n\n## Designing Reliable Workflows for LLM Agents\n\nDesigning reliable workflows for LLM agents involves more than just connecting them to external tools. It requires careful planning, error handling, and iterative testing. A well-designed workflow ensures that the agent can operate consistently, even in unpredictable scenarios.\n\n### Key Components of a Reliable Workflow\n\n1. **Input Handling**: The agent must be able to receive and interpret user inputs accurately. This includes understanding different formats, handling ambiguity, and filtering irrelevant information.\n\n2. **Tool Integration**: The agent should be able to seamlessly interact with external tools. This involves setting up secure connections, managing authentication, and ensuring data privacy.\n\n3. **Decision Making**: The agent must make informed decisions based on both its internal knowledge and external data. This requires a clear logic structure, often implemented through rule-based systems or more advanced reasoning frameworks.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: Workflows must include mechanisms for error detection and recovery. If a tool fails or returns invalid data, the agent should have a fallback strategy, such as retrying the request, using cached data, or informing the user of the issue.\n\n5. **Feedback Loops**: Continuous learning and improvement are essential for long-term reliability. By collecting user feedback and performance data, the agent can be refined to better meet user needs.\n\n### Example: A Customer Support Agent Workflow\n\nLet\u2019s consider a customer support agent that helps users with account-related queries. The workflow might look like this:\n\n1. **User Input**: The user asks, \"How do I reset my password?\"\n2. **Intent Recognition**: The agent identifies the intent as a password reset request.\n3. **Tool Integration**: The agent connects to the company's authentication API.\n4. **Action Execution**: The API generates a password reset link and sends it to the user's registered email.\n5. **Confirmation**: The agent informs the user that the link has been sent and provides instructions on how to proceed.\n6. **Error Handling**: If the email service is down, the agent informs the user and suggests alternative methods, such as contacting support via chat.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that the agent operates reliably and efficiently, even when external systems are not perfect.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLLM agents represent a powerful new paradigm in AI, combining the linguistic prowess of large language models with the actionable capabilities of external tools. By designing reliable workflows that incorporate these elements, developers can create intelligent systems that are not only capable but also trustworthy. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of LLM agents into real-world applications will become more seamless, opening up new possibilities for automation, personalization, and human-computer interaction.",
