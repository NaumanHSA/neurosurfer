To minimize hallucinations in a local large language model setup, ensure high-quality training data, fine-tune the model on relevant tasks, and use validation techniques like fact-checking or grounding prompts. Limit input length and complexity to reduce ambiguity. Incorporate feedback loops to correct errors and improve accuracy over time. Regularly update the model with new, accurate information. Use confidence thresholds to filter uncertain responses. Maintain transparency in the model's limitations to users.
