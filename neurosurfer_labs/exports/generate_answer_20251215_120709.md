To reduce hallucinations in a local LLM setup, focus on improving data quality by using accurate and diverse training data. Fine-tune the model on domain-specific datasets to align its knowledge with real-world scenarios. Implement validation checks to ensure outputs are factually consistent with known information. Use techniques like output verification or grounding in external knowledge sources to cross-check responses. Additionally, set clear response boundaries and encourage the model to admit uncertainty when necessary. Regularly update the model with new, reliable data to maintain accuracy and minimize hallucinations.
