To minimize hallucinations when using a local large language model, follow these steps:

1. **Use High-Quality Training Data**: Ensure the model is trained on accurate, diverse, and well-curated data to reduce biases and errors.
2. **Fine-Tune the Model**: Fine-tune the model on domain-specific data to improve accuracy and relevance for your use case.
3. **Implement Output Validation**: Validate model outputs against known facts or use external sources to verify information.
4. **Use Prompt Engineering**: Design clear, specific prompts to guide the model and reduce ambiguity.
5. **Enable Guardrails**: Integrate guardrails or filters to flag or block potentially hallucinated responses.
6. **Monitor and Iterate**: Continuously monitor model performance and update training data or fine-tuning strategies as needed.
