**Title:**  
*Stop Treating LLMs as Black Boxes: The Case for Observability-First AI Systems*

**Description:**  
This blog post explores the critical need for observability in large language model (LLM) systems. As LLMs become more integrated into production applications, the lack of visibility into their internal workings has led to significant challenges, including hallucinations, performance bottlenecks, and compliance risks. By adopting an observability-first approach, organizations can gain real-time insights into model behavior, trace requests end-to-end, measure performance metrics, and create feedback loops for continuous improvement. This article outlines the key components of an observability-first strategy, discusses common failure patterns in LLM systems, and highlights the role of tools and best practices in building transparent, reliable, and ethical AI systems.
