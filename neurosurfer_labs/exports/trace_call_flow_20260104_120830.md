### Call-Flow Narrative for GraphExecutor
The `GraphExecutor` is the core class for executing graph-based workflows. It is typically invoked by agents like `GraphAgent`, `CodeAgent`, `RAGAgent`, and `ReActAgent`. The execution process begins with loading a graph structure using `load_graph`, followed by validating the graph's configuration (e.g., checking for cycles, dependencies). The graph is then executed by traversing nodes in topological order, executing each node's associated tool or logic, and collecting results. The final outputs are selected based on the graph's defined outputs or the last node in topological order. The execution includes tracing and logging for debugging, and results are returned as a `GraphExecutionResult` object.
