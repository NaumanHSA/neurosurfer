To reduce hallucinations in a local LLM setup, follow these steps:

- **Use high-quality training data**: Ensure the training data is clean, relevant, and free from biases or errors.
- **Fine-tune the model**: Train the model on domain-specific data to improve accuracy and reduce irrelevant outputs.
- **Implement validation checks**: Use fact-checking tools or rule-based systems to validate outputs against known facts.
- **Set clear prompts**: Design prompts that guide the model toward accurate and relevant responses.
- **Monitor and update**: Continuously evaluate the model's performance and retrain as needed.

These steps help minimize hallucinations by improving data quality, model accuracy, and output control.
