To reduce hallucinations in a local large language model setup, follow these steps:

1. **Use High-Quality Training Data**: Ensure the model is trained on accurate, diverse, and well-curated data to improve factual consistency.
2. **Fine-Tune the Model**: Fine-tune the model on domain-specific data to align it with the intended use case and reduce irrelevant or incorrect outputs.
3. **Implement Output Validation**: Use fact-checking tools or post-processing to verify the model's responses against reliable sources.
4. **Adjust Temperature and Top-P Parameters**: Lower temperature values can reduce randomness and hallucinations by making the model's outputs more deterministic.
5. **Monitor and Iterate**: Continuously evaluate the model's performance and refine training and inference settings based on feedback.
