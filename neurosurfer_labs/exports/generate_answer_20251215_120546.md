To reduce hallucinations in a local LLM setup, focus on improving data quality by using accurate and diverse training data. Fine-tune the model on domain-specific datasets to align its knowledge with real-world scenarios. Implement validation checks to ensure outputs are factually consistent with known information. Use cautious prompting techniques, such as asking for step-by-step reasoning or including constraints. Regularly update the model with new, reliable data to keep it current. Additionally, consider using external verification tools or human oversight for critical tasks. These steps help minimize hallucinations by enhancing accuracy and reliability.
