### Intent Classification

**Query:** "How can I minimize hallucinations in a locally deployed large language model?"

**Intent:** **Instruction**

---

### Reasoning:
- The query is asking for **practical steps or methods** to achieve a specific goal (minimizing hallucinations).
- It is not seeking a **definition** of hallucinations or a **comparison** between models.
- It is not asking for an **explanation** of what hallucinations are, but rather how to **reduce them** in a specific context (local deployment).
- The phrasing "How can I..." indicates a request for actionable guidance or instructions
