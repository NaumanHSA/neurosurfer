To reduce hallucinations in a local LLM setup, focus on improving data quality by using well-curated and diverse training data. Ensure the data is accurate, relevant, and free from biases. Additionally, fine-tune the model on task-specific datasets to align its outputs with expected results. Implement validation checks during inference, such as fact-checking or cross-referencing with trusted sources. Limit the model's exposure to ambiguous or unreliable information. Regularly update the model with new, verified data to maintain accuracy. These steps help minimize hallucinations by enhancing the model's reliability and alignment with real-world knowledge.
