To reduce hallucinations in a local LLM setup, ensure high-quality training data, fine-tune the model on relevant tasks, and use validation techniques like fact-checking or consistency checks. Limit input length and complexity, and implement output verification mechanisms. Regularly update the model with new knowledge and monitor performance to identify and address hallucination patterns.
