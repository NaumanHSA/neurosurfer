To reduce hallucinations in a local LLM setup, focus on improving data quality by using accurate and diverse training data. Fine-tune the model on domain-specific data to align its knowledge with real-world scenarios. Implement validation checks to ensure outputs are factually consistent and relevant. Use techniques like prompt engineering to guide the model toward reliable responses. Limit the model's exposure to ambiguous or misleading inputs. Regularly update the model with new, verified information. These steps help minimize hallucinations by enhancing accuracy and reliability in local setups.
