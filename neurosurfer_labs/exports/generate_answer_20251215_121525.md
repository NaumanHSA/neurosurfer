To minimize hallucinations in a local large language model setup, focus on improving data quality by using curated, accurate training data and validating sources. Implement fine-tuning with task-specific datasets to align the model's outputs with real-world scenarios. Use prompt engineering techniques, such as adding explicit instructions or constraints, to guide the model's responses. Enable output validation through post-processing checks to filter out unreliable or fabricated content. Regularly update the model with new, relevant data to maintain accuracy. These steps help reduce hallucinations while maintaining performance in a local setup.
