To minimize hallucinations in a local large language model setup, focus on improving data quality by using accurate and diverse training data. Fine-tune the model on relevant tasks to align its outputs with expected results. Implement validation checks to verify the model's responses against known facts or logical consistency. Use techniques like temperature scaling and top-k sampling to control output randomness. Regularly audit the model's performance and update it with new information to maintain reliability. These steps help reduce hallucinations by enhancing the model's accuracy and alignment with real-world knowledge.
